type OvernightIndexSwapTransaction3 struct {

	// Defines the status of the reported transaction, that is details on whether the transaction is a new transaction, an amendment of a previously reported transaction, a cancellation of a previously reported transaction or a correction to a previously reported and rejected transaction.
	ReportedTransactionStatus *TransactionOperationType1Code `xml:"RptdTxSts"`

	// Unique and unambiguous legal entity identification of  the branch of the reporting agent in which the transaction has been booked.
	//
	// Usage: This field must only be provided if the transaction has been conducted and booked by a branch of the reporting agent and only if this branch has its own LEI that the reporting agent can clearly identify.
	// Where the transaction has been booked by the head office or the reporting agent cannot be identified by a unique branch-specific LEI, the reporting agent must provide the LEI of the head office.

	// Usage: when time is available, it must be reported.
	//
	// It is to be reported with only the date when the time of the transaction is not available.
	//
	// The reported time is the execution time when available or otherwise the time at which the transaction entered the trading system of the reporting agent.
	TradeDate *DateAndDateTimeChoice `xml:"TradDt"`

	// Represents the date as of which the overnight rate of the floating leg is computed.
	StartDate *ISODate `xml:"StartDt"`

	// Last date of the term over which the compounded overnight rate is calculated.
	MaturityDate *ISODate `xml:"MtrtyDt"`

	// Fixed rate used for the calculation of the overnight index swap pay out.
	FixedInterestRate *Rate2 `xml:"FxdIntrstRate"`

	// Defines whether the fixed interest rate is paid or received by the reporting agent.
	TransactionType *OvernightIndexSwapType1Code `xml:"TxTp"`

	// Notional amount of the overnight index swap.
