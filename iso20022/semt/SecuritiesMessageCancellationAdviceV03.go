// Scope
// This version is identical to the previous version. It was created automatically during the 2011/2012 maintenance cycle, at the same time as new versions of other Settlement and Reconciliation messages that were truly impacted by change requests. This should not have been the case. In future releases, SWIFT will ensure that a new version of a message is not created if identical to the previous version.
// An account servicer sends a SecuritiesMessageCancellationAdvice to an account owner to inform of the cancellation of a securities message previously sent by an account servicer.
// The account servicer/owner relationship may be:
// - a central securities depository or another settlement market infrastructure acting on behalf of their participants
// - an agent (sub-custodian) acting on behalf of their global custodian customer, or
// - a custodian acting on behalf of an investment management institution or a broker/dealer.
// Usage
// The previously sent message may be:
// - a securities settlement transaction confirmation
// - a report (transactions, pending transactions, allegements, accounting and custody securities balance)
// - an allegement notification (when sent by mistake or because the counterparty cancelled its instruction)
// - a portfolio transfer notification
// - an intra-position movement confirmation
// - a transaction generation notification
// The previously sent message cannot be a status advice message (any). If a status advice should not have been sent, a new status advice with the correct status should be sent, not a cancellation advice.
// The message may also be used to:
// - re-send a message previously sent,
// - provide a third party with a copy of a message for information,
// - re-send to a third party a copy of a message for information.
// using the relevant elements in the Business Application Header.
// ISO 15022 - 20022 Coexistence
// This ISO 20022 message is reversed engineered from ISO 15022. Both standards will coexist for a certain number of years. Until this coexistence period ends, the usage of certain data types is restricted to ensure interoperability between ISO 15022 and 20022 users. Compliance to these rules is mandatory in a coexistence environment.  The coexistence restrictions are described in a Textual Rule linked to the Message Items they concern. These coexistence textual rules are clearly identified as follows:  “CoexistenceXxxxRule”.
